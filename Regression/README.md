## Linear Regression and Hypothesis Testing
- The linear regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
- In our project, we are analyzing the relationship between crime count and various demographic factors such as poverty rate, unemployment rate, racial diversity, and income diversity.
- We have used concepts of Linear Regression and Hypothesis Testing which we have learned in class here.  

### Borough Level Regression - borough_level_regression.iypnb
    1. Analyzed the relationship between crime count and the demographic factors at the Borough level.
    2. Analyzed the relationship between crime count and the demographic factors controlled by the Population at the Borough level.

### Sub Borough Level Regression - sub_borough_level_regression.iypb
    1. Analyzed the relationship between crime count and the demographic factors at the Sub Borough level.
    2. Analyzed the relationship between crime count and the demographic factors controlled by the Population at Sub Borough level.
    
## Hypothesis Testing
    1. The level of significance considered in our analysis is 0.05. 
    2. The null hypothesis states that the demographic factor doesn't affect the crime count.
    3. The null hypothesis is rejected if the p-value is less than 0.05.
    4. The null hypothesis is not rejected if the p-value is greater than 0.05.
