## Linear Regression and Hypothesis Testing
- The linear regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
- In our project, we are analysing the relationship between crime count and various demographic factors such as poverty rate, uneployement rate, racial diversity and income diversity.
- We have used concepts of Linear Regression and Hypothesis Testing which we have learnt in class here.
