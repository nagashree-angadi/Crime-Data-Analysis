## Linear Regression and Hypothesis Testing
- The linear regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
- In our project, we are analysing the relationship between crime count and various demographic factors such as poverty rate, uneployement rate, racial diversity and income diversity.
- We have used concepts of Linear Regression and Hypothesis Testing which we have learnt in class here.  

### Borough Level Regression - borough_level_regression.iypnb
    1. Analyzed the relationship between crime count and the demographic factors at Borough level.
    2. Analyzed the relationship between crime count and the demographic factors controlled by Population at Borough level.

### Sub Borough Level Regression - sub_borough_level_regression.iypb
    1. Analyzed the relationship between crime count and the demographic factors at Sub Borough level.
    2. Analyzed the relationship between crime count and the demographic factors controlled by Population at Sub Borough level.
    
## Hypothesis Testing
    1. The level of significance considered in our analysis is 0.05. 
    2. The null hypthesis states that demographic factor(poverty rate, uneployement rate, racial diversity and income diversity) don't effect the crime count.
    3. The null hypothesis is rejected if the pvalue is less than 0.05.
